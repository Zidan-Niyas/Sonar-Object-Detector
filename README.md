# Sonar-Based Object Detection System using Arduino
- Designed the servo-controlled scanning mechanism for precise and dynamic object detection.
- Integrated ultrasonic sensors and Processing software to enhance real-time object distance measurement and visual representation.
- Evaluated the data visualization process leading to accurate and interactive display of object positions and distances on a radar-like interface.
